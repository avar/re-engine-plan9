=head1 NAME

re::engine::Plan9 - Plan 9 regular expression engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use re::engine::Plan9;

    if ("bewb" =~ /(.)(.)/) {
        print $1; # b
        print $2; # e
        print $'; # wb
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Replaces perl's regex engine in a given lexical scope with Plan 9
regular expression provided by libregexp9. libregexp9 and the libfmt
and libutf it depends on from Plan 9 are shipped with the module.

The C</s> modifier causes C<.> to match a newline (C<regcompnl>) and
the C</x> modifier allegedly causes all characters to be treated
literally (C<regcomplit>), see regexp9(3). The engine will C<croak> if
it's given other modifier.

If an invalid pattern is supplied perl will die with an error from
regerror(3).

=head1 CAVEATS

The Plan 9 engine only supports 32 capture buffers, consequently match
variables only go up to C<$31> (C<$&> is number zero).
